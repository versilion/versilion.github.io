<h1>Chase Ambrose</h1>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Welcome! I'm an ambitious electrical engineering student currently pursuing my degree at the <em>University of Missouri</em>,
     with sights set on graduation in 2026. <br> In the realm of creativity, I find my solace in video editing,
      particularly excelling in <em>Adobe After Effects</em>, a skill I've honed over four dedicated years. <br> For many years,
       I planned on pursuing a career in the <b>visual effects</b> industry, but I’ve decided to pursue it as a hobby instead. <br>
        Beyond the technicalities of circuits and semiconductors,
         I immerse myself in crafting personal video projects during my spare time,
          designed to ignite a spark of inspiration in others and encourage them to embark on their own video editing journeys. <br>
           This fusion of engineering prowess and artistic passion is a core part of who I am,
            driving me to not only succeed in my academic pursuits but also to share the joy of video creation with the world.
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I graduated from Grain Valley High School with a High School Diploma, and afterwards,<br>
I pursued my passion for automotive technology by attending an automotive tech school where I earned a certificate in automotive technology.<br>
Building on this foundation, I am currently enrolled at the University of Missouri with plans to complete mybachelors in electrical and computer engineering and graduate in 2026.<br>
This educational journey has been a progression from high school, through specialized training in automotive technology, to pursuing a higher education degree,<br>
allowing me to combine my technical skills and academic knowledge for a well-rounded education.</p>
