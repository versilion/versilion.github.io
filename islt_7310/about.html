<h3>About me</h3>
<body>
<p>Welcome! I'm an ambitious electrical engineering student currently pursuing my degree at the <em>University of Missouri</em>,
     with sights set on graduation in 2026. <br /> In the realm of creativity, I find my solace in video editing,
      particularly excelling in <em>Adobe After Effects</em>, a skill I've honed over four dedicated years. <br /> For many years,
       I planned on pursuing a career in the <b>visual effects</b> industry, but I’ve decided to pursue it as a hobby instead. <br />
        Beyond the technicalities of circuits and semiconductors,
         I immerse myself in crafting personal video projects during my spare time,
          designed to ignite a spark of inspiration in others and encourage them to embark on their own video editing journeys. <br />
           This fusion of engineering prowess and artistic passion is a core part of who I am,
            driving me to not only succeed in my academic pursuits but also to share the joy of video creation with the world.
