Welcome! I'm an ambitious electrical engineering student currently pursuing my degree at the University of Missouri,
    with sights set on graduation in 2026. In the realm of creativity, I find my solace in video editing,
    particularly excelling in Adobe After Effects,
    a skill I've honed over four dedicated years.
    For many years, I planned on pursuing a career in the visual effects industry,
    but Iâ€™ve decided to pursue it as a hobby instead. Beyond the technicalities of circuits and semiconductors,
    I immerse myself in crafting personal video projects during my spare time,
    designed to ignite a spark of inspiration in others and encourage them to embark on their own video editing journeys.
    This fusion of engineering prowess and artistic passion is a core part of who I am,
    driving me to not only succeed in my academic pursuits but also to share the joy of video creation with the world.
