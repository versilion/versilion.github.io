            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:80px;">Welcome! I'm an ambitious electrical engineering student currently pursuing my degree at the <br> <em>University of Missouri</em>,
            with sights set on graduation in 2026. In the realm of creativity, I find my <br> solace in video editing, 
            particularly excelling in <em>Adobe After Effects</em>, a skill I've honed over four <br> dedicated years.  For many years,
            I planned on pursuing a career in the <b>visual effects</b> industry, but <br> I’ve decided to pursue it as a hobby instead.
            Beyond the technicalities of circuits and semiconductors, <br>
            I immerse myself in crafting personal video projects during my spare time,
            designed to ignite a spark <br> of inspiration in others and encourage them to embark on their own video editing journeys. <br>
            This fusion of engineering prowess and artistic passion is a core part of who I am,
            driving me to not <br> only succeed in my academic pursuits but also to share the joy of video creation with the world.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p style="margin-left:80px;">I graduated from <em>Grain Valley High School</em> with a High School Diploma, and afterwards, I pursued <br>
                    my passion for automotive technology by attending an automotive tech school where I earned a certificate <br> in automotive technology.
                    Building on this foundation, I am currently enrolled at the University of Missouri <br> with plans to complete mybachelors in electrical and computer engineering and graduate in 2026.<br>
                    This educational journey has been a progression from high school, through specialized training <br> in automotive technology, 
                    to pursuing a higher education degree,allowing me to combine my technical <br> skills and academic knowledge for a well-rounded education.</p>
